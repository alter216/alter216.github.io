# *The Boy and the Heron*

When I walked into the movie theatre to see *The Boy and the Heron*, I knew three things about it: Miyazaki pronounced it is his last movie; it is dedicated to Miyazaki's grandson; and it has a strong anti-war message--as my officemate suggested, possibly his most emphatic anti-war movie yet. I was surprised by this claim, considering that the first line of *Grave of the Fireflies* is: "September 21, 1945... that was the night I died."

The movie opens with the night sky of wartime Tokyo illuminated by fire, burning scraps of paper floating on wind currents. A hospital has been bombed in an air raid–-the same hospital where the sick mother of young Mahito is staying. He sees the fire from his window and, horrified, runs out of the house and through war-torn streets, trying to somehow save her, only to watch the whole building explode into flames before his eyes.

The title card then flashes on the screen. At that moment, sitting in the movie theatre, I learned that I didn't know the title of the movie. It read: 君たちはどう生きるか, kimi-tachi wa dou ikiru ka. I was shocked not only that the title is totally different from the English translation, but also that I could actually read it with the ruins of my Japanese knowledge. "How do you live?" That's the real title, with "you" being the second-person plural.

After a timeskip of a few years, Mahito’s father marries his dead wife’s sister, who conveniently looks almost identical to his dead wife. He moves his family to the countryside and builds his budding career as a military industrialist. Mahito has grown to be a quiet, serious schoolboy with no friends, and recurring traumatic flashbacks of a burning hospital. 

In his new home, a sinister enchanted heron recognizes Mahito and taunts him about his dead mother. It speaks with a raspy voice, its head grotesquely unfolding to reveal a fleshy human mouth with giant teeth.

Enraged, Mahito prepares to fight the heron. He finds a book in his father’s library on the making of a bow and arrow. In the middle of his work, he stumbles across another book with a handwritten note from his mother. He is shocked to find that it is addressed to him, stating that it is a gift for him when he is older. The book is titled: *How Do You Live?* He reads it in one sitting, teardrops falling onto the pages by the end.

# *How Do You Live?*

The library scene was both filled was such a non-sequitur from the plot that I was convinced it had to be a real book. And so, I found that the first *How Do You Live?* is a children’s book published in 1937 by a staffer at a publishing company named Genzaburou Yoshino. He was originally asked to write a primary school ethics textbook. Yoshino instead wrote a coming-of-age novel, possibly to make the lessons into something kids would actually remember; or to evade the *Tokkou*, the Japanese thought police, who would have suppressed the liberal, Western ideas he espoused. Or maybe both. In any case, the plot of Miyazaki's movie is not at all the same as that of Yoshino's book, but there exists a thread of inspiration.

Many criticisms of Miyazaki's movie center on its lack of coherence or a clear plot. I believe that it’s most similar to what it means to live. There are all kinds of loose ends and unsatisfying conclusions. People are disappointing, life is disappointing. Nothing is ever neat.

But in this respect, Yoshino’s book is the polar opposite–it clearly articulates a wide range of moral lessons and takeaways. The format is unlike that of any other children’s book I’ve read. The story centers on Copper, a mischievous, precocious schoolboy who is raised by his widowed mother. Shortly before Copper’s father died of illness, he made a special request to his brother-in-law to look after the boy, saying: “I want him to become a great man! A fine example of a human being.” Copper’s uncle takes this wish to heart, putting effort into spending time with him and teaching him. The story is interspersed with letters the Uncle writes to a more mature Copper, drawing ethical lessons from Copper’s experiences to guide him as he grows as a human. 

The Uncle's lessons range widely: from reflections on poverty and economic relations, to a psychological portrait of Napoleon’s rise and fall; a discussion of Gandharan Buddha sculptures as an emblem of the symbiosis between East and West, to an argument for peace based on Blaise Pascal’s writings on human greatness. I was struck by the feeling of wishing I had someone who believed in my ability to learn from a young age, who could have taught me such things when I was younger. Or barring that, at least wishing I had read this book.

The following is an example of some of this writing:

> If it weren’t natural for people to live together in harmony, then why would we suffer when we felt a lack of harmony? If we should try to live a life of love and goodwill toward others but instead find ourselves driven by hatred and hostility, we feel unfortunate because of that, and for that reason, we suffer.

> Furthermore, anyone should be able to cultivate their own talents and to work according to those talents, so people suffer when they can’t do that, and feel they can hardly endure it.

> People feel sad and suffer like this because it’s not natural to have such hatred and hostility toward each other. Also, because it’s wrong that they cannot freely cultivate the talents with which they were born.

> [...]

> Naturally, pain is not unique to human beings. Even dogs and cats may shed tears if wounded, and when they are lonely, they howl piteously. When it comes to physical pain or hunger or thirst, humans are surely the same as other animals. That’s why we experience a keen sense of empathy and feel great affection for other living creatures on the planet, be they dogs, cats, horses, or cows. But that also means that pain alone tells us little about what it means to be truly human.

> We learn true humanity from a pain that only humans feel, even in the midst of experiencing all the same pain as other living things.

Yoshino’s intellectual yet down-to-earth writing represents a hope that children are capable of internalizing his lessons on thinking for yourself; on striving for the good of all humanity; on empathy and peace. Yoshino’s book closes with Copper beginning a notebook of his own, resolving to write his impressions of life just as his Uncle did for him. He writes:

>  I think there has to come a time when everyone in the world treats each other as if they were good friends. Since humanity has come so far, I think now we will definitely be able to make it to such a place. So I think I want to become a person who can help that happen.

The truth of Yoshino's world in Japan, 1937, however, was that of the Japanese invasion of China and the launch of WWII military campaigns in the Pacific Theatre. 

Even before this point, Japanese ultra-nationalism had been growing in fervor for decades. It was in 1919 that Ikki Kita published his militaristic manifesto *An Outline for the Reorganization of Japan*. Secret societies proliferated throughout the country in the 1920’s, clamoring for Japanese cultural chauvinism and a totalitarian military state led by the emperor, who was revered as a god. In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria and installed a colonial puppet regime. That same year, Yoshino, then a fresh university graduate with a degree in philosophy and literature, was imprisoned for 18 months for involvement with socialist thinking.

Yoshino's book was published right on the precipice of the deadliest conflict in human history. Tens of millions would perish, and somehow the world kept going, immediately careening into another war and the proliferation of new weapons capable of razing the Earth many times over. Humans failed to rid themselves of the chauvinistic ideas that those of other races are intrinsically worth less. 

And so, how is it possible to still hope for a better world? How do you live?

This question, in its different facets, is the crux of the relationship between Yoshino’s and Miyazaki’s work. Where Yoshino asks how to live to become a good person, one who makes the world better through their relationships with other people, Miyazaki questions how it is possible to live in a senseless, hopeless world, where good people act with violence and greed; where people build weapons of war without questioning the way it distorts their souls.

These differing perspectives can also be read as emerging from their respective historical moments: before the bloodshed of WWII; and afterwards, with the observation that humans did not learn from their mistakes. 

The forms of these two worldviews can be gleaned by comparing the social lives of Copper and Mahito. Copper’s father worked at a bank before dying of an unfortunate illness, and Copper is raised by his gentle and devoted mother who never remarries. He is surrounded by a small band of loving friends. 

On the other hand, Mahito’s mother died in a hospital bombing as a casualty of war. Mahito is raised by his military industrialist father, who expresses his care by flaunting his wealth, and seems to grieve so little for his dead wife that he replaces her with a lookalike sister, although he still clearly loves his son. Mahito doesn’t have happy interactions with other children: he is bullied by the other schoolkids, and he doesn’t have any friends to speak of.

Ultimately, both Yoshino and Miyazaki answer their titular question in the form of an uncle-mentor in their stories. Copper is guided by a hopeful uncle who teaches him about the importance of human relations in creating a better world, guided by a fundamental belief in human greatness. On the other hand, Mahito’s grand-uncle chooses to give up on Earth and escapes to an alternate fantasy world, free from the evil and suffering of the original. As long as a set of magical toy blocks he has crafted can be stacked into a balanced tower, harmony and order in his pure, untainted world can be preserved. 

But in contrast to Copper, Mahito doesn’t accept his grand-uncle’s answer. He argues that it’s impossible to seek peace through self-isolation while maintaining your own humanity. It is human to be tainted by violence in some way; one cannot interact with society and remain pure.

Besides that, it is necessary to go out into the world and live with pain: after all, as Copper's uncle says, pain is important because it demonstrates how humans naturally want to live. Without pain, there is no image of a pure, harmonious world. 

Much pain is caused by the love we have for others, and our desire to be loved in return. Much pain is caused when we have a stymied hope that people will treat us well, and that we ourselves will treat them well in return.

What Mahito learns, and what his grand-uncle refuses to accept, is that in pursuit of a harmonious world, it is necessary to get along with and care for other people--even if they are imperfect; even if they don’t understand you. Mahito learns to love his stepmother even though she represents the replacement of his mother. He gets along with his father despite his callousness. If one chooses only to love those that one can unconditionally accept, then humans will never accomplish peace.

Perhaps Miyazaki sees himself in the grand-uncle, and that he hopes for his grandson to inherit the character of Mahito.

The pervasive aura of bitterness in this movie was mesmerizing and very different from many other Ghibli movies. Memorable images include the fake mother that melts away into slime; the plushie-like yet ravenous human-eating parakeets; the dashing parakeet leader clad in militaristic sash and shiny leather boots. The animal-like contortion of Mahito’s father’s face when angrily discussing bribes to the schoolmaster; the inscription on the golden gate of the grand uncle’s island that states: “Those who seek my knowledge shall die”.

Overall, the bitterness I see in the movie seems to reflect the regrets of an old man for a world of sorrow he is soon to be leaving. And the movie does seem to have a semi-autobiographical flavor to it as well. Miyazaki was born in 1941 and experienced a bombing when he was four years old, which left a lasting impression on him. His father was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes. His mother spent much time in the hospital during his childhood due to spinal tuberculosis. He was treated as an outcast at school for being sickly and weak, with digestive problems. 

It's strange to imagine someone who went through war at such a young age, the kind of thing that I have only understood from history textbooks, to feel disappointed in how the world has not learned anything since the 80 years of his life, indeed, is beginning to remilitarize.

If I manage to achieve that age, wonder what kind of world I will be leaving at the end of my life, and if I, too, will feel regretful and bitter. Fiction rarely describes what it means to be old because from what I can tell, it seems to be boring, sad, or both. In any case, whatever dying is like, humans continue to live through moments of beauty and happiness, or at the very least, clarity, moments that justify continued existence and a desire to somehow change things.
